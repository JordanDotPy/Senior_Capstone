## Project Description
Modern readers of online political content are often just looking for the facts so that they can form their own opinions. Unfortunately, many news sources and articles are biased to one side or the other in their reporting, which can make up readers’ minds for them. For readers who don’t have the time to investigate every author, source, and claim, our tool will provide a simple bias score for any online news article. Readers will then be able to make informed decisions about which articles they choose to read and check other sources if they wish.
