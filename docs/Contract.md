4\. Project Focus & Description

The "Bias News Detector" will be a web-based application that uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze news articles and determine potential bias. The application will consider factors such as language patterns, sources cited, and context to measure the level and type of bias present.

5\. Tentative Roles & Responsibilities

- Project Manager: Oversee the project's progress, manage timelines, and coordinate with faculty advisors.
- Lead AI/ML Developer: Handle the main coding tasks, ensuring the software functions correctly and meets specifications when it comes to the backend process of the Natural Language Processing of the news given.
- Data Scientist: Work on creating example data to train the model on, establish the bias scoring system.
- Lead Web Developer: Design the web-framework architecture, both frontend and backend, for the application.
- QA/General Developer: Ensure all aspects of the project are up to specification and work well together while avoiding bugs or defects. Will also act to aid the other developers as needed.

(Note: These roles are tentative and will be detailed further in Assignment   #5 Task List and Assignment #6 Effort Matrix.)

6\. Expectations and Conflict Resolution

*   All team members are expected to contribute and meet assigned deadlines actively.
*   Any member unable to meet a deadline should notify the team in advance.
*   Conflicts should be resolved through open dialogue. The issue will be escalated to the faculty advisor if a resolution isn't reached.
