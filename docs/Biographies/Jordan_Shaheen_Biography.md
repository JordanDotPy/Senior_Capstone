  - **Website Link:** [industrial.southwire.com](http://industrial.southwire.com)
  - **Software Involved:** Python, HTML, CSS

### Remarcable: Webscrape Application
**June 2021 – August 2021**
- Independently created a Django webscrape admin function to parse dimensional cable data from a private Southwire website to more accurately depict needed dimensiona and electrical calculations.
- The application is accessed through Southwire VPN and parses the private site with the BeautifulSoup package.
  - **Software Involved:** Python

### Remarcable: Optical Character Recognition Application
**June 2022 – August 2022**
- Cooperatively created an Optical Character Recognition application to parse important data from Invoice, Quote, and Sales Order PDFs before transferring data to multiple databases using APIs.
- Used Django as backend with Tesseract, OpenCV, and Camelot packages. 
- The frontend app components were created with Angular10 and Angular Material.
- The application was in beta upon exit from Co-op.
  - **Software Involved:** Python, HTML, CSS, Angular10, Angular Material, TypeScript

### Remarcable: API webhook and Dockerize Website
**June 2023 – August 2023**
- Worked independently to create an API webhook that sends JSON data to target URLs based upon the creation, deletion, or changes of product models detected within Southwire Industrial's admin portal.
- Transferred the whole website into Docker by containerizing the applications used within the website and provided needed updates on the required packages used within the website.
  - **Website Link:** [industrial.southwire.com](http://industrial.southwire.com)

## Project Sought

I am open to ideas that will challenge my current knowledge of software development and an opportunity that will allow me to work with software that I have yet to have the chance to express ideas with. If someone has an idea that coincides with my interests, or you think I will bring good insight to your project, feel free to contact me within one of my contact sources written above.  Some possible ideas I have already considered are:

- Virtual Classroom Application
- Natural Language Processing for Research and Studying
- Smart Campus App
- UC Club Reccomendator/Forum/Status Website
- Automated Lecture Transcriber for Notes and Studying
- Machine Learning Related Application
- Bias Detector in News
- AI Generative Content Creator

Overall, I would prefer a capstone that is web-related.  Also, I'd rather create a project with a feature or application that could benefit quality of life more than I want to do an entertainment-oriented project.  However, I would enjoy working with any machine learning or AI-related project, as it is very prevalent in Computer Science.
