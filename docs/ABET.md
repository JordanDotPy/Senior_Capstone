The development and deployment of our news bias detector are influenced by multiple economic, ethical, security, and social constraints. Economically, our project relies heavily on open-source software and publicly available tools due to the short time for development, and our team has no budget for the project. These circumstances may limit the range of features we can offer and the quality of our bias detection. Professionally, this project aims to bolster the reputation of an unbiased, factual news distribution. From an ethical standpoint, our detector's potential influence on a user's perception of news presents a significant challenge. Our tool mustn't inadvertently promote a particular narrative or suppress another, ensuring its impact remains neutral. Security concerns also arise, mainly related to user data privacy. Since users will submit news article URLs for analysis, measures to prevent data breaches and ensure the anonymity of user submissions are paramount. Socially, the news bias detector is intended to serve the broader public by promoting informed citizenship. By helping users discern biases in news, we aspire to enhance the quality of public discourse. Environmental and cultural constraints are less predominant in our project; however, our design is focused on accessibility, ensuring diverse user groups, irrespective of language or background, can benefit from our tool.
